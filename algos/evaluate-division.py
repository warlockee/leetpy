I learn the solution from @mlaw0.
He used BFS, so I use DFS. The runtime is almost the same.
But I think BFS is more suitable in this case, bc we don't have to go down that deep.

we know if a/b=2, b/c=3, then
1. b/a=1/2, c/b=1/3 [2]
2. a/c=2*3, becasue (a/b)*(b/c)=a/c=2*3
we can build graph: a->(b, 2), b->(c, 3).
a->(b, 2) means a-->2-->b
b->(c, 3) means b-->3-->c
so if we need a/c, we are finding a-->?-->c, which is a-->2-->b-->3-->c, which is a-->2*3-->c

first we build the graph [0]
for every query, we find from the starting point (n1) itself [1]
in the stack is the next thing we want to check if it is n2
we keep on pushing neighbor or neighbor's neighbor to the stack until we find n2 [3]

to prevent we visit the visited node we use a set to keep track [4]

we can further optimize the answer by updating the graph at the same time
bc it is not likely that we build the graph for a single search [5]
