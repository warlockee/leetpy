Starting from `(0, 0)` we keep on selecting the neighbor with lower elevation until we reach the end.
There are four possible neighbors `(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1)`.
Every time we select neighbor  we check if we visited and choose the smallest elevation to go.

The above solution is worng, because we might reach a point which all its neighbor is visited (dead end).
That is why we need a heap to get the next posible point to go.
And when we reach dead end, we pop out the next avaliable option.
The time complexity is O((N^2)*LogN), for there are N^2 point and every heap operation for it is LogN.
Space complexity is O(N^2)

The answer must lie between `l` and `h`.
Where h is the value we sure that it can pass, l is the value it might or might not pass.
So we gradually test the value between `l~h` by binary search.
Until we find the value which is the lowest possible time that can pass. #[0]

I init the `l` with the `t` of the destination, because we couldn't have been reach the destination without using `t` amount of time.
I init the `h` with the max `t` in the entire grid, since we can swim withim this time no matter what.

The function `canPassWtihTimeLimit(t)` takes a parameter `t` and use DFS to see if we can swim to the destination in the time limit t.

The time complexity is O((N^2)*LogN).
Find the max in the grid took O(N^2).
`canPassWtihTimeLimit(t)` took O(N^2), because we might possibly travel the entire grid.
We call `canPassWtihTimeLimit(t)` about O(LogN) of time because we use the binary search concept to navigate the `l` and `r`.
