"""
First, we define an 2-D matrix `hp`.
`hp[i][j]` is, when entering (i, j), the minimum health required, so that we can reach the princess.

So what is the value of `hp[i][j]`?
At `(i, j)`, we always go to next place where its minimum health required is lowest. (Either `(i+1, j)` or `(i, j+1)`).
And if the value is, for example, `-4` at `(i, j)` the requirement will need to add `4` (`- D[i][j]`).
So the minimum requirement at (i, j) will become:
```
min_required = min(hp[i+1][j], hp[i][j+1]) - D[i][j]
```
Now if `min_required` is smaller or equal to `0`, it means that we don't need any requirement at all, set it to minimum, `1`.
```
hp[i][j] = min_required if min_required>1 else 1
```

Now we only need to work it backward so that we can deduct from the value we are sure.
I add extra row and column to the `hp` and set the bottom and the right of the princess to `1`.
so we don't need to look out for boundaries.
```
hp[N][M-1] = 1
hp[N-1][M] = 1
```

The time complexity is O(NM). Since we only traverse the 2-D matrix twice.
One is for constructing `hp`. The second is calculate the value in `hp`.
The space complexity is O(NM), too.

I learn my anser though [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/discuss/52826/A-very-clean-and-intuitive-solution-(with-explanation)) which has an awesome explaination, too.
