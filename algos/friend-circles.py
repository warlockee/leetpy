For every person #[1]
We use `dfs()` to traverse all its network and mark all the visited people. #[2]
So if the someone is visited, this means that he/she is in other people's friend cicle already. #[3]
So If Bob is never visited, `circles` adds 1 to represent all the people in the new network. #[4]

Time Complexity is O(N^2), we at most travel every node in the 2D array.
Space Complexity is O(N).

"""
We use the `roots` to store every node's root.
So if at index 1 value is 5, means that node1's root is node5. #[1]

We use `find()` to find a node's root by finding the node's parent and parent's parnet... #[2]
Along the way, we also update all the node we encounter.
This technique is also called path compression.

So for every connection, we `union()`, making those two node and all of their parent point to the same root. #[3]
All the children under the root is in the same friend circle.

At last, we count how many unique root in `roots`. #[4]

When we `find()`, we only update all the node's parents until we reach the root. #[5]
We did not update the node's child.
That is why we need to `find()` every node again.
To make sure all nodes in the `roots` has the right value.

Time Complexity is O(N^2) for `find()` is really close to O(1) in average.
Space Complexity is O(N)
