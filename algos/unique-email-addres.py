"""
[0]
First we use set to store the processed email
set is implement in hashmap, so it takes O(1) to store unique value.

[1]
Split the email by '@' to local_name and domain_name

[2]
we find the first '+' and remove the char after it.

[3]
we remove the '.' in the string.

we iterate the local_name part 3 times
first time we are finding the first '@'
second time we are finding the first '+'
third time we are finding all the '.'

isn't faster to just iterate once?
so I come up with the second solution which only iterate once to process the email
but it is slower, I guess Python really do a good job on the string function
because they are implemented by C.
in other language, the second solution might be faster.

both solution are O(N)
