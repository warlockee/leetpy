"""
perform BFS to the tree:
we traverse every node in the level then go to the next level
every level we traverse from right to left
if it is a level we haven't been through before
we add the node's val to the output

time efficiency is O(N)
because we basically go through all the nodes
N is the total nodes count

space efficiency is O(N)
since we my store the whole level of the tree in the queue
the last level is 0.5N
N is the total nodes count
