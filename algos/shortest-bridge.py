"""
First, identify one of the island by marking its value by 2 (island2). [0]

Second ([1]), use BFS to go through another island (island1). When we encounter 0 we put it on `q2`, otherwise `q`.
When q is finished, it means that the island1 is completely explored (all `(i, j)` is in the `visied`).
Now we make put `q2` to the `q` and clear `q2`. [2]

When q is finished, it means that all of the one-tile outward `(i, j)` is explored (in the `visited`).
Now we make put `q2` to the `q` and clear `q2`.

When q is finished, it means that all of the two-tile outward `(i, j)` is explored (in the `visited`).
Now we make put `q2` to the `q` and clear `q2`.

...

We keep on doing this until we find the island2. [3]

The time complexity is `O(N)`, `N` is the number of element in `A`.
The space complexity is `O(N)`, too. Since we might put most of the `(i, j)` in the `visited`.

Of course, we can optimize the space, by changing the value in the `A`.
The code would be a little bit harder the read and understand.
I challenge you to try it out!
