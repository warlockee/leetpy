"""
`l` and `r` are the points on width that form the area.
The height on `l` is `H[l]` and `r` is `H[r]`.
The area that form by `l` and `r` is `(r-l)*min(H[r], H[l])`.

We are going to calculate the area everytime we move `l` or `r`.
And maintain the `ans`, which is the max of all area.

Now, we put `l` and `r` at the beginning and at the end of the array.
We calculate the area and update `ans`, move `l` or `r` inward.
How are we going to find a larger area with shorter width that form by `l` and `r`?
The answer is, we move the `l` or `r` with shorter `H[l]` or `H[r]`, so we might get a larger `min(H[r], H[l])`, which leads to possibly larger area.

By doing this, we now have a new pair of `l` and `r`.
We calculate the area and update `ans`, move `l` or `r` inward.

...

We repeat the process until `l` and `r` collapse.
So by repeatedly moving `l` and `r` inward, we can run through all the shorter width that might form area larger than `ans`.
