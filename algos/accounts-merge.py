"""
Treat each email as a node.
Build an adjacency graph. [0]

For every account's data
First, lets check if the first email is already merged. [1]
If the first email is already merged to other groups, then other emails will be in another group as well.
So don't need to check.

Second, do a DFS starting from the first email. Put all the connected nodes into visited. [2]
And append the sorted(visited) to the ans with name. [3]

Let N be the total number of emails. M be the total number of final groups.
Build the graph takes O(N).
For each final groups, we make a DFS to all nodes, taking O(MN).
Sort the group takes O((N/M)*Log(N/M)) -> O((N/M)*(logN-LogM))
Time: O(MN)
Space: O(N)
