Iterate through the board.
When we spot a starting point, we `dfs()` to see if it can finish the word.
To prevent travel to the visited node, we use a hash-set `set()` to keep track of what we have visited.
`l` is the index of the character in the `word` we are checking.
Note that we need to use `visited.copy()` to copy a whole new hash-set, or all the `dfs()` will use the same hash-set, which is not what we want.

The time complexity is `O(N^2)`, `N` is the number of nodes. You can think of it as for each node, we have to decided to go ot not to go, and we need to make the decision `MN` times.
The space complexity is `O(W*N)`, `W` is the length of `word`. Because the recursion level is `W`, and for each recursion we need to keep track of `visited`, which potensially takes `O(N)`.

"""
As you see, the above solution takes lots of space.
Another way is to change the character on the `board` to `#` to represent it as visited.
After the `dfs()` call we need to change it back. Because other branch of `dfs()` might not need visit this node, or haven't visit this node.

The time complexity is `O(N^2)`, `N` is the number of nodes.
The space complexity is `O(W)`, `W` is the length of `word`. Because the recursion level is `W`.
This answer is inspired by @caikehe's [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/discuss/27660/).
