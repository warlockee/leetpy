"""
We ramdomly pick a string from 'strs' as 'bench_mark' [0]
Lets say the 'bench_mark' is 'flower'
We compair 'f', 'fl', 'flo'... to every other string [1]
If any string does not match, we return the longest common prefix [2]
In ths case the whole 'bench_mark' is actually the longest common prefix [3]
We need to return the 'bench_mark'
