"""
In both solution, the `counter` counts how many of each num in nums, as `counter[num]`=`num's count`
The bottle neck is we need to get k nums which has largest count (in an efficient way).
And here is how `Bucket Sort` and `Heap` comes in.

* Bucket Sort can sort things really quick, the trade off is we need to use lots of space. 
Now, because we know that the max possible count of each `num` is the count of `nums`.
We can make an list (`bucket`), where index 0~`len(nums)`, representing the count.
Every index `i` stores a list. In the list, all `num`  has exactly i count.
Next we can iterate backward, from large index to small index (from higher count to lower count), until we got k element in the output.

* Heap. We use the counter to build a max heap. Then we pop out the num which has higher count.

Time space analysis.
* Bucket Sort. For time complexity, build the counter takes O(N), build the bucket also takes O(N).
Getting the k num which has the highest count also takes O(N). So time complexity, is O(N).
Space complexity is O(N). For buckets at most takes every element in `nums`.

* Heap. For time complexity, build the counter takes O(N), build the heap also takes O(N).
(Yeah, I know. Some People thinks `heapify` takes O(NLogN) but it actually takes O(N). But that is another story...)
Pop out from heap takes O(N) and we do that k times, kLogN.
So time complexity, is O(N+kLogN).
Space complexity is O(N).
