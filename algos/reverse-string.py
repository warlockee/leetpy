"""
Reversing a string is equivalent to
Switch the first and the last, the second and the second last, the third and the third last...
So I use two pointers, 's' at the start, 'e' at the end.
If e and s collapse, the proccess is finished.

(a, b) = (b, a) is equal to

temp = a
a = b
b = temp

For time complexity is O(N), N is the length of the string.
Space complexity is O(1), because I only use pointers and a space to store one char.
