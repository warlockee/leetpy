"""
If we use the solution from the [last question](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/),
We will notice that it will have some duplicates.
This is because if you have three 2 (`[2, 2, 2]`).
You might choosing two different sets of 2 and end up looking the same.
For example, you choose the first and the second => `[2, 2]`
You choose the second and the third => `[2, 2]`

One workaround I did is just using hash-set.
```
return list(set([tuple(combination) for combination in answer]))
```
This cause us really high time complexity.
Since turning list to tuple and tuple to list is actually O(N) in theory.

Time complexity would be `O((2^N) * N)` be cuase for each element in the answer we need to convert it to tuple and back.

I found the best solution and explaination is made by @ZitaoWang's answer and here is his [explaination](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/discuss/171626/Python-solution). I copied from it.
For example, `nums = [1,1,2,2,2,4,4,5]`. In this case, `counter = {1:2, 2:3, 4:2, 5:1}`.
We intialize `answer = [[]]` and build the solution iteratively as we loop over the counter.
We first reach `num, count = 1, 2`. The power set of [1,1] is `[[], [1], [1,1]]`.
Then we reach `num, count = 2, 3`.
The power set of [1,1,2,2,2] is obtained by appending either zero, one, two or three 2's to all elements in `answer`.
After which we get answer = [[], [1], [1,1], [2], [1,2], [1,1,2],[2,2], [1,2,2], [1,1,2,2],[2,2,2], [1,2,2,2], [1,1,2,2,2]].
After we loop over counter, answer will be the power set of nums.

Time complexity: `O(2^N)`, space complexity: `O(2^N)`.
