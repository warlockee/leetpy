"""
I see space as the end of a word.
If a word end I will add it to the left of the output.
That is why I have to add an extra space to the original 's' [0]
Be careful There may be continuous space or space at the start and the end. [1]
The way we combine string, there will be an extra space at the end, so I remove it. [2]

Time complexity is O(N).
Because we loop through the stirng once.

Space complexity is O(N).
Because we use 'opt' to store the output.
