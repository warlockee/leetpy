"""
let's reset the array by it's min value start out from (0,0)
in another words, after reset
grid[i][j]'s value will be the min value start out from (0,0)

if we are at (i,j), we will be either from (i-1,j) or (i,j-1)
we call them s1 and s2, let's assume they are both in range
grid[i][j] will be grid[i][j]+min(s1, s2)

we will start out from (0,0) and reset the entire grid.
