"""
If you haven't seen [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/), I suggest you do that first!
And here is the [explaination](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/discuss/387753) for that problem.

This problem is basically the same as [that problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/) with its N=9.
The difference is we have to find the combination that sum up as N.
So all we have to do is change the condition of [0]. And the condition for backtracking [1].
