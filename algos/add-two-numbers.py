"""
Add numbers, units to units digit, tens to tens digit...
If the added number is greater than 9
We will add 1 to next digit (`temp`) and only take the units digit of the added value.

For example, if we are adding units digits, 3 and 9, the sum is 12.
12 is greater than the 9, so we set `temp` to 1, so when we are calculating tens digits it will `+1`.
And we only take the units digit of 12, which is `12 - 10 = 2`.

The time complexity is O(N), N is the length of two linked list.
Space complexity is O(N), since we need to store a new linked list.
