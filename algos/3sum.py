This is the answer from @caikehe and all the comments below

The main idea is to iterate every number in nums.
We use the number as a target to find two other numbers which make total zero.
For those two other numbers, we move pointers, `l` and `r`, to try them.

`l` start from left to right.
`r` start from right to left.

First, we sort the array, so we can easily move i around and know how to adjust l and r.
If the number is the same as the number before, we have used it as target already, continue. [1]
We always start the left pointer from `i+1` because the combination of 0~`i` has already been tried. [2]

Now we calculate the total:
If the total is less than zero, we need it to be larger, so we move the left pointer. [3]
If the total is greater than zero, we need it to be smaller, so we move the right pointer. [4]
If the total is zero, bingo! [5]
We need to move the left and right pointers to the next different numbers, so we do not get repeating result. [6]

We do not need to consider `i` after `nums[i]>0`, since sum of 3 positive will be always greater than zero. [7]
We do not need to try the last two, since there are no rooms for `l` and `r` pointers.
You can think of it as The last two have been tried by all others. [8]

For time complexity
Sorting takes `O(NlogN)`
Now, we need to think as if the `nums` is really really big
We iterate through the `nums` once, and each time we iterate the whole array again by a while loop
So it is `O(NlogN+N^2)~=O(N^2)`

For space complexity
We didn't use extra space except the `res`
Since we may store the whole 'nums' in it
So it is `O(N)`
`N` is the length of `nums`
