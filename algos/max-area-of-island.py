"""
0 means water.
1 means land.
2 means land we already visited.

We iterate the map using a double for-loop.
When we encounter 0 or 2, we skip.
When we encounter 1, we do a dfs() to mark all the land on the same island as 2. So we don't count it again.

Time: O(N). We iterate all the island once. If visited, we will skip.
Space: O(1).
